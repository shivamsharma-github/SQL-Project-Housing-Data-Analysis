# SQL-Project-HousingDataAnalysis

- In this project, I have done data cleaning on our housing dataset using SQL.
- Imported data from excel file to SQL Server.
- Standardized data format in SaleDate Column from DATETIME To Date
- Populated Property Address Data
- Split PropertyAddress into individual columns (Address, City)
- Split OwnerAddress into individual columns (Address, City, State)
- Replace values 'Y' & 'N' To 'Yes' & 'No' In SoldAsVacant Column
- Removing Duplicates from our data. Please note this is not advisable when working on real dataset
- Removing unused columns from our data - It is not advisable to remove columns from original dataset
